# Hello, I'm a French software engineer

# I program in this languages:
- Batch:    Extremely slow, but doesn't need any compiler under Windows
- Lua:      I haven't done much of it
- Python:   Simple, pretty high level language BUT _much slow than C++_
- Java:     Fast and pretty _simple_
- C++:      Very fast, low level language

> My favourite language is C++ because it's really fast
